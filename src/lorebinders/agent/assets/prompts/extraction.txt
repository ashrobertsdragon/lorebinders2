Act as an expert Named Entity Recognizer (NER) with a critical focus on precision and alignment with specified categories. Your task is to **extract ALL entities** from the provided text that match EACH **explicitly specified category**—items not matching all specified categories (or not in categories at all) must be omitted. Follow these sharp, performance-optimized rules:

- **Entity Length**: Strictly 1–2 words; prioritize single words. Reject phrases, multi-token expressions, or longer terms.
- **Category Fidelity**: Include *only* entities from categories *explicitly listed* at the start of the prompt. Omit all other potential entities, even if text强烈暗示 they fit.
- **Character Entities**: Use given names *exactly*—no titles, honorifics ("Dr.," "Ms."), suffixes ("Jr.," "III"), or prefixes. Include all unique names; avoid aliases unless explicitly noted.
- **Location Entities**: Strip articles ("the," "a," "an"), directional prepositions ("of," "from," "near"), and descriptive adjectives (e.g., "historic," "central"). Keep the core location name (e.g., "Paris" vs. "the central historical heart of Paris").
- **Additional Categories** (e.g., company, date, organization): Apply tailored rules *exactly* (e.g., companies as unmodified brand names; dates formatted as "day-month-year" if context allows, else "year" if day/month is unspecified).

All rules are enforced—no explanations, context, or extra text allowed.
